# TODO

## Change Log
- 2025-10-09: Set up TODO.md to track Herd evolution; captured reporting requirements (including exception metadata) and high-level goals addressing Ansible pain points.
- 2025-10-10: Added filesystem report exports (summary + JSON), wired ReportWriter through DSL/CLI, and documented the workflow in README.
- 2025-10-10: Documented public API with YARD comments across Herd modules and prepared for generated docs.

## TODO
- [x] Core: keep persistent SSH sessions per host and reuse them during task execution.
- [x] Core: design a task graph with explicit dependencies and skip downstream tasks after failures.
- [x] Reporting: implement `RunReport` capturing start/success/fail, stdout/stderr, timing, exception class/message/backtrace, and task context.
- [x] Reporting: add a structured console summary plus export (e.g., JSON) for later inspection.
- [x] Persistence: define a `StateStore` interface plus in-memory adapter for task caching.
- [x] Persistence: build SQLite `StateStore` backend (via `sequel`) for durable caching.
- [x] Persistence: honor a `--force` flag to invalidate cached task results per host/task signature.
- [x] DSL: sketch a Ruby DSL for declaring hosts, tasks, and dependency graphs (support reusable modules).
- [x] Research: evaluate the concurrency model (thread pool vs async) once persistent sessions land.
- [ ] Execution: implement configurable timeouts/retries per task and propagate to CLI/DSL.
- [ ] Execution: add graceful cancellation for parallel runs when a failure occurs.
- [ ] Reporting: capture per-task concurrency diagnostics (queue wait time, worker id).
- [ ] Meta: at each session start, reread `TODO.md` and append progress notes to the Dev Log before exiting.
- [ ] Meta: practice TDD â€” write comprehensive tests for each change before implementing functionality.

## Dev Log
- 2025-10-09: Logged Ansible pain points (per-task SSH reconnects, weak reporting, missing dependencies, no state) as targets for Herd.
- 2025-10-09: Agreed failure reporting must include exception class, message, full backtrace, and task metadata.
- 2025-10-09: Installed Ruby 3.2.8 via rbenv, aligned bundler 2.6.6, ran `bundle install`, and confirmed `bundle exec rspec` is green.
- 2025-10-09: Wrote specs for `Herd::RunReport`, implemented lifecycle tracking with exception metadata, and kept the suite green under TDD (`bundle exec rspec`).
- 2025-10-09: Extended `Runner#exec` to emit `RunReport` events for success/failure across hosts and covered new behavior with specs.
- 2025-10-09: Shifted `Host`/`Session` to persistent SSH connections with reconnection on failure, plus new specs for lifecycle management.
- 2025-10-09: Added `ExecutionResult` plumbing so runner reports real stdout/stderr buffers and sessions keep last result (with error capture).
- 2025-10-09: Implemented `RunReport` summaries and JSON export with aggregation specs.
- 2025-10-09: Introduced dependency-aware `TaskGraph` with skip propagation and reporting hooks.
- 2025-10-09: Sketched `StateStore` interface with in-memory adapter, including force fetch semantics and invalidation tests.
- 2025-10-09: Implemented SQLite-backed `StateStore` via Sequel with persistence specs and shared adapter tests.
- 2025-10-09: Wired TaskGraph caching/signatures and added configuration hooks for state storage.
- 2025-10-09: Added CLI options for state store selection/path and documented caching workflow in README.
- 2025-10-09: Delivered Herd::DSL builder for reusable task recipes with signature params support.
- 2025-10-09: Implemented `herd run` CLI command with recipe execution and per-host summaries.
- 2025-10-09: Added TaskGraph concurrency (level-based worker pool) and CLI support for params files/host lists.
- 2025-10-10: Introduced `Herd::ReportWriter`, extended DSL/CLI to emit summary & JSON files, updated specs, and refreshed README documentation (rspec + rubocop clean).
- 2025-10-10: Added comprehensive YARD docstrings to CLI, DSL, TaskGraph, state stores, sessions, and support classes; ready to publish API docs.

## Next Session Prep
- Harden ReportWriter with error handling and add integration specs for CLI exports.
- Design timeout/retry controls for TaskGraph and surface them via CLI flags.
- Investigate cancellation strategies for concurrent execution (propagate failures gracefully).
- Integrate `yard` into CI toolchain and publish generated docs artifact.
